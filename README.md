Project Overview:
The Stopwatch Project is a web application designed to provide users with a simple and intuitive interface to measure elapsed time. This project showcases fundamental web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and demonstrates the ability to create interactive and user-friendly web applications.

Features:

Start/Stop Functionality: Users can start and stop the stopwatch with a single click.
Reset Button: Allows users to reset the timer to zero.
Lap Functionality: Users can record lap times and view them in a list.
Responsive Design: Ensures the application is usable on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
Visual Feedback: Provides a visually appealing and dynamic display of the elapsed time.
Technologies Used:

HTML: For the structure and content of the application.
CSS: To style the application and ensure a visually appealing interface.
JavaScript: For the core functionality of the stopwatch, including time calculations and user interactions.
Implementation Details:

HTML Structure: The layout consists of buttons for start/stop, reset, and lap functions, as well as a display area for the timer and a list for lap times.
CSS Styling: The application uses modern CSS techniques to ensure a clean and responsive design, including Flexbox for layout and transitions for smooth visual feedback.
JavaScript Logic: The stopwatch functionality is implemented using JavaScript's setInterval function to update the timer display every second. Event listeners handle user interactions for starting, stopping, resetting, and recording lap times.
